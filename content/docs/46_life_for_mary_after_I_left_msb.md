# Life for Mary After I Left MS/B
It was always a little bit weird for Mary while I was working at MS/B as everyone thought that Mary was getting her ideas from me. Which was never the case. They did not recognize her natural ability to ask the right kinds of questions to build relationships with the clients who were using the tools and build the tools that they needed.

After a short while out of there within a few months, Mary was given the Product Manager role for the Marshall & Swift products. This is the same division that we had both been working under as opposed to the Boeckh side which was insurance. She went through several bosses and always building up more and more products that came under her toolage.

MS/B also went through several rounds of owners. The original owner made the company feel like family. Then it was sold to McDonald Dettwiler and Associates (Canadian company famous for making the robotic arm for the  Space Shuttles and International Space Station. Then to some Equity Company and finally to Corelogic who then did the foolish thing of changing the name. This was foolish because Marshall & Swift is actually written into law that properties must be accessed using Marshall and Swift data. This now opened the door to competition.

The other thing that Corelogic did was determined to close down the Los Angeles office. They owned a tower in Irvine and that was were the base of operations was going to take place. Anyone that lived more than 50 miles from there would get a nice severance package and be let go. Mary was one of the last people to go and they begged her to stay long enough to train her replacement.
