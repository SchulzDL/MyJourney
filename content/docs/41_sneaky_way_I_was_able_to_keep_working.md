# The Sneaky Way I Was Able to Keep Working
With the shut down of One, Inc. the project manager, Andi, for the Hilton project that I was working on called the client to let them know what was going on.  They wanted to continue the project to completion. The next call that Andi made was with a competing software company in Marina Del Rey if they were interesting in taking in the people working on this project as we came with a very lucrative project.

They made a very nice presentation of the benefits to signup with their company to those of us on the Hilton project. I was not able to join up with the rest of the employees that signed up because of my immigration status. However, Mary and I had put together a company to build some projects on the side and with Mary being the president she was able to get a contract with Hilton directly and I was the employee of our company “The Web We Weave, Inc.” Hilton’s legal department is very strict about companies that it gives contracts with. However, they were very helpful to us in providing us with the information of the insurance companies that they preferred and what kinds of insurance that they required. 

This all happened in our favor because the piece that I was working on was the reconciliation piece that brought all these reservation systems together and was the source of truth of what the actual reservation amounts were and match up with the income. Hilton wanted this very badly and did everything that they could to get me to complete this part of the project.  The money was really good, but we had to buy our own health care and do our own payroll and taxes. Somewhere in all this I did get my working permit so I could apply for work once again after the Hilton contract ended.
