One day this guy that I had never met or seen before came by my office at Schulz Motors and invited me out for coffee.  I was referred to him by an ex-girlfriend of mine Tracy Parcels and he started drawing the Amway Circles of a self made business opportunity.  I did make a trip into Edmonton to a presentation made by his sponsor at their warehouse setup.  They were pretty high up in the business and their setup was pretty impressive.  I learned a lot from this group and pretty soon we were running our own shows in Barrhead where I would draw the circles and my brother Rod and his wife Lauretta would demonstrate the products.  We got a lot of people involved in our operation and I somehow got myself into a little bit of trouble, not on my attempts to pull anything off. 

What happened was there was this  banker that worked at the Toronto Dominion Bank and he set me up with a line of credit.  I guess it wasnâ€™t a legal loan and he got in trouble over it. I think he may even gotten fired. The bank set me up with an actual loan to payoff the line of credit and I included in it the money that I got from my Dad so that I could pay him back. He used that money to finish off the new house that we were building. He was able to build the new house with the money from the sale of the old house and the money I threw in plus his savings, no mortgage.
