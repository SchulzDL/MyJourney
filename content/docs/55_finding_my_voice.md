# Finding My Voice
As I started writing I noticed that my lyric writing really improved from where it was back in the 70’s. I guess with all the therapy and a wife that insisted that I put into words what I was feeling. I felt comfortable about being more vulnerable and talking about how I was feeling and being more honest with myself and with others. It was just like finding out why there was a closeness to my brother, I love him, but I can only be around him for short periods of time. I felt comfortable in telling him this and I think that realization between us has made us even closer.

These are the types of things that really affected my lyric writing so my plan in all of this is to put together an album that I would call “Finding my Voice” and it would document the journey that I took in order to find my voice. All along the way experimenting with recording and mixing as I was still learning this craft which is way different from writing and arranging.

For a while I was releasing each song as I completed them and there would be a new one every 3 or 4 weeks in most cases. The songs were good but my mixes, not so good and I was autotuning myself so much because I really am a bad singer and sing out of tune more than I do in tune. I was a learning experience and I picked up different tools along the way to help me through some of these problems that I was having.
