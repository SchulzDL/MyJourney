# Native Instruments M32 Keyboard
{{<picture src="/images/M32Keyboard.png"  width="300 px">}}
I found this keyboard which was just over $100.00 that I could buy on-line. I think I bought it from the online version of Guitar Center. It was a small midi keyboard not a synthesizer but capable of making music out of sample data. This was not what I was expecting as it came with the smaller version of Komplete Kontrol which was part of a large sample library of real and live instruments and loops. That peaked my interest that things had changed quite a bit since my music creation days. In addition to the Komplete Kontrol software was also an 8 track version of Ableton Live Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). This was the new modern recording studio.

This became my entry point to getting back into serious writing and recording music once again. The entry fee into this industry was very low, but I also realized that in the past I had a lot of people like Richard that did much of the technical engineering and besides, although I now had some tools, I really did not know how to use any of it.

I started taking courses to learn as much as I could about Ableton Live and using the tools that were now at my disposal. I worked on this for months and months and then it happened, I started writing again and putting my music onto disk.
