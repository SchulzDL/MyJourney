# The Story Ends Here for Now
We have pretty much reached my present day so although this journey is far, far from over this is where we landed when I finished putting this all down on paper. Some of my plans in the near future are to finally release my album “Finding my Voice” which I am hoping to do by my 69th birthday, we will have to see how that goes.

When I finally do retire from my current employment my plan is to move to an area that I want to live in taking away the constraint of being close to work. My immediate thought is to either move to Hollywood or downtown Los Angeles. Either of these will be a loft or apartment that is a little bigger than my current one so I can move my Grand Piano into it.

I will continue to write and to release music. I have several concept albums that I want to do under the artist known as “The Donald Schulz Project”. I am also launching my own label “Boiler Music Group” where I plan to rerelease some of the Thunderfoot tracks. Rita Miller and I have been talking about releasing some of the music that She and Thomas Schaff have recorded and never released. 

If things do go to plan and we get some interesting stories along the way, you might see a part II of this journey. It was a good and interesting road, not exactly as I expected but the end results were. I always dreamt to living in southern California and low and behold it happened so it wasn’t the music that got me here but now that I got here lets make some noise. I AM HERE!
