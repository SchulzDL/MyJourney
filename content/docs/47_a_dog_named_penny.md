# A Dog Named Penny
Somewhere around 2016, Mary was really pushing for another dog. We hadn’t had any pets since Rudolf and Misty died. Moving downtown would not have been possible if we had pets and now that Mary was back at the Simi Valley house and I was on the road every week it seemed, she wanted to get another dog.

There was this rescue team that was setup every Saturday in front of the animal feed store that we always catered to called Theresa’s Country Feed & Pet. There Mary found a Carin Terrier that was used as a breeding dog and the owners decided to get rid of her and keep one of her puppies as their new breeding dog. They dropped her off at a high kill shelter which is where this rescue team saved her from. The story of her sad life just really appealed to Mary. In a way I feel like I was tricked as she said, “You won’t have to do a thing, I will take care of her and do all the work, just please let me have this dog”. How could I refuse that, and so Penny became a member of our family.

Penny has also really changed my mind and my attitude when it comes to dogs. Of all the dogs I have had in the past, always felt that they belonged outside and could come in the house for special occasions. However, Penny was so respectful of our stuff and property. She would tear her toys apart as she knew that was hers but she never touched any of our stuff. She followed Mary around like a shadow and just always wanted to be where we were. She is very smart and very aware of our emotions and does what she can to keep comforted.

I learned so much from Penny and I am convinced that she understands what we are talking about. I would have some serious conversations with her, talking to her like you would a young child, meaning in simple terms. Then amazing to me, she would do exactly what I was asking of her. I am so impressed by her and I think it is a lot to do with her breed and just that Penny is very special.
