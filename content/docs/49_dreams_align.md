# Dreams Align
On the first week of Mary’s searching she found an amazing house in Thousand Oaks.  The owner of this home was a music composer and the layout of this house was amazing. It resolved some issues that Mary had with me always being upstairs working on the computer which I had to do as we had a couple of products that we were supporting and the only time I could work on them was when I was at home. This house had a hugh Grand Room which was open to the kitchen and an office right there. It would have taken away the isolation that was felt when I was upstairs on the computer and Mary was downstairs either in the kitchen or in the grand room. The other thing that really caught my eye was that he had a Baby Grand piano in the formal living room. We never had room for such an instrument in our old home. The house was all on one floor up on a hill and over looked the Conejo Valley Botanic Garden. It had two master suites each with their own tankless water heater. I was a really nice house and one that we could easily afford.

We put in an offer with the condition that we needed to sell our house, and that did not go over with the sellers as they were looking for a fairly quick sale to move to Ohio. Although we did not get that house it ignited a new fire and spark in both Mary and I that we could go after and get the kind of home that we both would love. Mary has always wanted a house that resembled an English Tutor which caught her interest ever since her Dad took her and her brother to Europe when they were young.

Mary continued to look and pretty much every weekend we had a short list of houses to look at and even though we didn’t put an offer on any of them we were gathering ideas of some of the things that we liked about the property. The other thing that we both agreed on is it really needed a view.
