# Finding My Mary
{{<picture src="/images/Mary and Donald Wedding.png"  width="300 px">}}
When I first moved to California I was browsing the dating apps. There weren’t that many, not like the thousands that are available today. I did not meet anyone when I was writing to these ads that I liked so I decided to create my own ad and see what kind of people I could attract. I had about 5 woman contact me and we wrote back and forth for a time. Two of them dropped off pretty quick as they did not say much in their correspondence so it got pretty boring writing to them. I did have a date with one, I remember she had red hair and although I called myself well travelled she had a lot more travel miles behind her than me. It was just this one date, I don’t think we really found a good footing. Another interesting girl lived in Merced. She was from Japan, I think she was going to school there and I think she was hoping to find an American who could sponsor her. That could not be me as my stay was also temporary with my TN permit, it did not provide permanent residency. However, before she came to that realization she travelled by bus and stayed with me for a couple of days. I also think she had a boyfriend that she was upset with at this time in Merced. She was a bit hard to understand as her english was quite broken, and I remember I took her to the movie “The Matrix” and had to explain it to her in simpler terms. She went back to Merced by bus again, a little earlier than originally planned.

In the meantime, there was Mary. She wrote long detailed emails and I responded with even longer detailed emails. We must have written back and forth for about 3 months before we finally met up for our first date at Chilis in Simi Valley. Mary had two children, Bryan (12) and Renee (8) from her previous marriage and I got along with them quite well. Many Saturdays were spent on the water with my officemate Bob from M1 where we would go halves on the rental of a sailboat and sail around in the Santa Monica Bay.

After about a year of dating Mary and I got married on a beach in Malibu. Most of my immediate family came out for the wedding. My brother and his entire family, wife Lauretta and their 4 boys Lyndon, Dalton, Tyson, and Colton. My sister Connie and my Mom. My mother was both happy and sad. She was glad that I had finally found someone that I often described as the female version of myself, but sad because she knew that this would be my permanent home. July 15, 2000 we got married, went on a honeymoon at lake coeur d'alene resort and when we got back I moved into the house that Mary purchased after her divorce on Booth Street in Simi Valley.

All this time I was driving my Nissan 300ZX and it still had Alberta plates on it and I knew I would not be able to legally plate this in California as in previous trips to California I ran into other 300ZX owners and they complained about how it was a major hassel to get an oil change, cost them a fortune because of how much of the car they would have to take a part to get the oil out. In the mean time I bought a brand new Maxima, you know the 4 door sports car. After all I had a growing family now, time to put away the sports car and get into a stylish family car, with a sporty feel.

Now that I had my replacement car it was time to get the 300ZX back to Canada so Mary and I drove it back. It was a fun road trip but it was a trip that was not advised to do by my immigration legal team because I was still travelling between borders with my TN permit and being married to an American sort of violates the temporary goal of the permit. After we dropped off the car we flew back but as we went through US immigration we went through different lines and initially sat separately until we were on the US side of the trip. Just precautions we took to not be questioned about marital status.
