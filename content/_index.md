# The Donald Schulz Story: My Journey
{{<picture src="/images/the-dsp-logo.png"  width="200 px">}}
This started off as the long bio version that goes into great detail about my journey in the field of music specifically in music creation and production.  However, it has turned into more of a not so mini memoire of my journey in the music industry, out of the industry and then back again for the final chapters to complete the circle.  This is yet just another example of what goes around comes around.

I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. It really brought me back to remember and even to connect with people that I had been out of touch with for such a long, long time. Because of the amount of time that did pass, some of the details that I would have like to have shared might have been lost.
